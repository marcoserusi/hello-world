# hello-world
This is my first repository, I created it because a bot told me to, and you should always listen to bots. 

After 10 years working in marketing an management I discovered coding and I am now hitchiking my way through many new languages with the help of a fish stuck in my hear and a towel. 

With luck one day it will hold 42. 

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
